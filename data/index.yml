  desc: "<em>Love Fund</em> helps you easily make recurring monthly donations to a number of high-impact organizations that are fighting against the initiatives of the Trump Administration. These organizations were carefully selected to represent the myriad of issues under siege, such as climate change, human rights, and religious tolerance. Many of these organizations have been cited and written about by the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/nonprofit-donations-trump.html' target='_blank'>New York Times</a>, <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/donald-trump-donations/507668/' target='_blank'>The Atlantic</a>, and the <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/11/30/its-unprecedented-in-our-history-after-trumps-election-millions-of-dollars-poured-into-nonprofits/' target='_blank'>Washington Post</a>."
